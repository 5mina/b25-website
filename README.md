# github versioning

## format:
[name] _ [major] . [minor] . [patch] _ (subname)

the name shall be in full and camel case for 1.0.0

versions after 1.0.0 will have a compact name instead of the name it already had (i.e. placeHolder becomes ph). some deviation will be allowed if said compact name was already taken.

subnames can be added to add a little spice to the changes in the new version. only add them along with minor and major versions.

### modified semver
• major - code restructuring

• minor - adding, deleting, or modifying a feature

• patch - modifying files

# rules
• using camel case for file names is highly recommended
