LOV3: 
Movie nights are always fun and I enjoy them a lot. I love being able to cuddle up to the members, especially Wooyoung and this is the perfect opportunity. I chuckled at what happened in the movie before turning to giggle with Wooyoung about it, except what I saw made me pause in confusion. Wooyoung’s entire body looked tensed, his shoulders were pulled up, his hands clasped tightly in his lap, his face was red and his eyes. His eyes looked over, they were glazed over as he looked at the TV, or rather through it. It didn’t even look like he was registering what was playing, rather just staring blankly. I slowly lifted my hand and waved it in front of his face but he didn’t react. Didn’t even flinch or blink, just continued to start blankly ahead.
